Welcome to this repository featuring a comprehensive set of Beamer
presentation slides for Christopher M. Bishop's book, [Deep Learning:
Foundations and Concepts](https://www.bishopbook.com/). Developed
chapter-by-chapter during my own self-study journey through the text (what's
a better way of learning something than pretending that you're teaching that
very same thing), these slides aim to summarize and present the core ideas
from each section.

Both the full LaTeX source code (under `src`) and the compiled PDF versions
(under `pdf`) are provided for every chapter.
